# 🚨 GEO-VAULT — *LOCATION TRACKING TOOL* 

![Status: Lab Only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Lab--Only-yellow?style=for-the-badge) ![Made with ❤️](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-Firewall%20Breaker-blue?style=for-the-badge)

> **Short description:** A polished front‑end demo that showcases browser geolocation flows, animated UI, and safe local logging for educational and defensive research. **This repository is explicitly for lab use and learning — it does not implement real exploitation techniques.**

## 🎯 Project purpose

WiFi HACK X is a **visual simulation** that demonstrates how a modern, animated cybersecurity UI can request permissions, display progress and notifications, and POST location data to a local logger for research. It is built to teach UX, consent flows, and privacy-aware logging — not to perform or instruct unauthorized access.

## 🔎 Files of interest (from your `index.html`)

* `index.html` — Front‑end demo containing:

  * Animated header and background video (`#earth`) using a Mixkit asset.
  * A matrix rain canvas and flying node animations for visual flair.
  * A permission popup that requests **geolocation** (`navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`).
  * A `fetch('save_location.php', ...)` call that POSTs `lat`, `lon`, `acc`, `ip` and `time` to a local endpoint.
  * Fake/placeholder "hack" messages and simulated password cards (intended as demo content).
  * Share buttons and promotional flows (YouTube/Instagram link and a simulated premium upsell UI).
  * Audio feedback and notification rotation for live effect.

> ⚠️ Note: `save_location.php` was referenced in the front‑end. If present, ensure it only logs to a local file and is not publicly exposed.

## ⚖️ Safety & Legal Disclaimer

* **Do not** use this project to collect data from devices you do not own or from users without explicit, documented consent. Doing so may be illegal and unethical.
* The demo intentionally contains **mocked output** (fake passwords, fake hack success messages). Keep such content clearly labeled as `SAMPLE` in any public version.
* If you want to publish a public demo, implement an explicit consent workflow, remove any impersonation or claims of real compromise, and present only sanitized sample data.

## ✅ Recommended safe setup (local / development only)

1. Clone repo and run a local static server (example using Python):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

2. If you need the PHP logger for research **on your machine only**:

```bash
php -S localhost:8001
# open http://localhost:8001
```

3. Test on devices you own. Inspect the saved logs locally and verify no sensitive real data is stored or transmitted externally.

## 🧭 How the demo behaves (high level — safe)

* When the user clicks **SCAN NETWORK**, the UI shows a permission popup. If the user allows, `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` is used to capture coordinates (client‑side), and the front‑end then POSTs those coordinates to `save_location.php` on the same host.
* Immediately after, the UI runs a scripted sequence of fake log messages and reveals **simulated** password cards — purely for UX demonstration.
* The share buttons and promotional flow are standard front‑end actions (WhatsApp, Telegram, copy‑to‑clipboard for Instagram).

## 🛠️ Suggested privacy & safety improvements (practical)

1. **Explicit consent checkbox + record consent** before collecting geolocation. Log consent with timestamp and a SHA256 signature of the form data (locally) so you can demonstrate consent without exposing extra PII.

```html
<!-- minimal consent flow snippet (frontend) -->
<label><input type="checkbox" id="consent"> I consent to share my location for demo purposes</label>
<button id="scanBtn">Scan Network</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById('scanBtn').onclick = () => {
    if(!document.getElementById('consent').checked){
      alert('Please give consent first'); return;
    }
    // proceed to request geolocation
  }
</script>
```

2. **Sanitize and reduce precision**: store coordinates rounded to 3 decimal places (≈100m) when demonstrating privacy‑preserving options.
3. **Label demo data**: prefix any fake password or sample device name with `SAMPLE_` so researchers and reviewers cannot misinterpret output.
4. **Local-only logging & auth**: keep `save_location.php` behind localhost and do not deploy it to a public server without strict authentication, HTTPS, and legal review.

## 🧩 UX / Branding & Animated Assets

* The current `index.html` uses a Mixkit video and a remote audio file. For a polished repo:

  * Replace remote assets with local copies included under `assets/` with license notes.
  * Add a small GIF (≤2–3MB) showing the UI for the README header and a branded SVG logo.
  * Use Shields badges for `License`, `Status: Lab Only`, and `Contact`.
